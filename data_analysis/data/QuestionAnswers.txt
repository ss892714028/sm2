Autonomic centers are specialized limbic cortex and brainstem nuclei that collect information from afferent (sensory) neurons, process the information and create appropriate autonomic (visceral) efferent motor outputs (reflexes) to involuntary muscles, cardiac and smooth, as well as glands which are the effectors of the autonomic nervous system. There are two branches of the autonomic nervous system—sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic branch is comprised of autonomic (visceral) efferent neurons connected to their cell bodies in the lateral horn of the spinal cord’s grey matter in the thoracic and lumbar (thoracolumbar) regions. Sympathetic (thoracolumbar) autonomic neurons regulate internal visceral functions associated with physical and emotional stress (fight-flight response). The parasympathetic branch is comprised of autonomic (visceral) efferent neurons connected to their cell bodies in the lateral horn of the spinal cord’s grey matter in the sacral region of the spinal cord and brainstem nuclei associated with four cranial nerves (craniosacral division is a synonym for parasympathetic) (CNs III, VII, IX and X)  The parasympathetic (craniosacral) branch of the autonomic nervous system regulates internal visceral functions associated with absence of stress, normal resting conditions (rest and digest). Tissues and organs have different balances of sympathetic versus parasympathetic signaling when at rest. For example, the cardiac muscle in the heart exhibits a predominance of parasympathetic signaling at rest when the cardiac output is low; whereas the smooth muscle in the urinary bladder exhibits a predominance sympathetic signaling at rest when the urinary bladder is filling.  The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system regulates blood pressure partly by changing the diameter of blood vessels of the large systemic circulation. Therefore, it is likely that this woman’s drop in blood pressure was associated with some amount of dehydration that decreased her circulating blood volume and pressure combined with decreased sympathetic outflow from the brainstem vasomotor centers (nuclei) in the medulla oblongata which increased the diameter of her systemic blood vessels (vasodilation).
